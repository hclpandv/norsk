This is a collection of my personal notes while I a, learning Norwegian as a second language.  
I started learning Norwegian after moving to Oslo in Mar 2024.  

I will try and keep this blog updated as I go along.
I also published a [flash card app](https://hclpandv.github.io/norsk-flashcard/) which you must try to memorize what is really needed.
Flash card app is designed to use in your bus or train transit where you may wanna use your non productive time.
